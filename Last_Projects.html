    <h3>Scratch Project Game </h3>
    <h6 style="font-size:15.5px">SEPTEMBER 2019</h6>
    <p class="card-text">During my “Intro to Computer Science Principles” class, I worked with a partner to create a game in Scratch. Our objective was to create a unique game or story with Scratch’s drag-and-drop program. We programmed a maze game in which the user would have to avoid enemies and obstacles to find the key that grants them victory. In this project, my role was to brainstorm ideas and work on making the game's code function properly.<br><br>
    We faced many bugs in the code, which would result in a specific aspect of the game working incorrectly. I learned that I should frequently test the game while making additions to the code, so I would be less likely to make mistakes. It was also easier to pinpoint exactly where I went wrong in the code. </p>

    <h3>MIT App Inventor Game</h3>
    <h6 style="font-size:15.5px">OCTOBER 2019</h6>
    <p class="card-text">In my "Intro to Computer Science Principles" class, my partner and I created a mobile game in MIT App Inventor, modeled after the Colored Dots tutorial. Our objective was to use one of the tutorials App Inventor provided and add our own unique elements to the game. We followed the Colored Dots tutorial and made it into a Pictionary game. It was a two-player game, in which one user would have to draw something and the other would have to guess what it was.</p><br>
    <p>My role included finishing the tutorial individually, and then collaborating with my partner to brainstorm and implement ideas into the final product. We encountered many bugs while working on the tutorial, but we overcame them by looking through our code and carefully fixing any mistakes that we noticed. I also learned that keeping a fair amount of documentation helps when looking back at code and understanding the changes we made. </p>
