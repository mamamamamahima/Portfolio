               Since a young age, I have always wanted to pursue a career where I would be able to put my creativity to good use. Art and design has always been my lifelong passion, and the field of graphic design would allow me to exercise that passion into the work I do. I am always working on my own art projects on the side, even when other aspects of my life keep me quite busy. I have always had the ability to schedule my time, prioritizing what needs to get done, and using my time as efficiently as possible. I plan to maintain good grades throughout high school, while improving and experimenting with separate forms of both traditional and digital art. Using my time productively to work on both my academic and art projects has always provided me with a sense of satisfaction. The field of graphic design involves being the boss of your own schedule and being able to manage your time effectively, which are skills I am constantly performing and improving on daily.<br><br>

               Some qualities I have that would serve me well in the field of graphic design is that I am organized and experienced. I have always been organized, as I see it as more of a necessity than as a hindrance. I have always kept my own organizational systems to keep track of loose files and papers for school, and I have a designated place to write down tasks and goals I want to accomplish daily. I have been doing this for as long as I can remember, constantly improving in the organizational methods I use, and using my organized workspace to the best of my advantage. Additionally, I'm experienced, having taken art classes for over 7 years. I have worked with digital tablets, and regular pencil and paper, and I am constantly learning about new forms of graphic design.<br><br>

               One of my accomplishments in high school so far is that I've kept good grades, while also working on art and exploring new forms of design on the side. Even though it can be difficult at times, I always do my best to make time for myself and my passions. It isn't always easy to make time for much else, with the hours that go into school, homework, and extracurriculars every day, but I have learned that the work and dedication you put in reflects positively in your results.<br><br>

               I have constantly been learning more about art and design, and it's been a unique experience. Thank you for your time, and please feel free to explore the rest of the site to learn more about my interests and my experience.
